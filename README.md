# catprinter
Website for text and images printing on Bluetooth Cat Printers.

This project supports:
1. **MXW01** ("Pink" printers)
2. **Standard Cat Printers** ("Blue" printers, e.g., SC03h, GB01, GT01, etc.)

Printer technology and protocol reverse-engineering inspired by and adapted from:
* https://github.com/jeremy46231/catprinter (MXW01 protocol)
* https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer (Standard/Blue protocol)

The application automatically detects the connected printer model and selects the appropriate driver.
